Python is a powerful programming language that can be used for a variety of tasks, including analyzing data from a CSV file. We'll go over how to use Python to import data and run an analysis on it. We'll be using the pandas library, a popular data analysis tool for Python.
Amazon Best Sellers are updated every hour. The actual list is made of 100 books, but the data we're working with features just the top 50 books. 
In this tutorial, we will work with a CSV (comma-separated values) file that features some fun data about the top 50 best selling books on Amazon from 2009 to 2019 (provided by Kaggle).

The .csv file contains 550 books. Here are the seven columns:
Name: Book name
Author: Book author
User Rating: Amazon user rating (0.0 - 5.0)
Reviews: Number of user reviews
Price: Book price (as of 2020)
Year: The year(s) it ranked
Genre: Fiction or non-fiction

Pandas is a powerful and widely-used library in Python for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures and functions needed to manipulate structured data seamlessly.

This project will export the top 10 selling authors and the average rating by genre to a separate .csv files.
By default, these files will be saved in the same directory as our main.py file. We can specify a different directory by providing a file path instead of just a file name.

Conclusion :-
Congratulations! We've made it to the end of the tutorial! ðŸŽŠ

We were able to harness the power of Python libraries like pandas to analyze data from a CSV file. Specifically, we did the following:
--> Imported book data about the top 50 books on Amazon from 2009 to 2019.
--> Explored and cleaned the data with DataFrame methods.
--> Exported the modified data to a new CSV file.
